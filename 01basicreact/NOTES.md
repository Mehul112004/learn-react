# Intro
React is basically a framework which focuses on interactivity and lets us update states throughout our page no matter how deep it is

# Create an App
we can create a react app by either CRA(create react-app) or by any package bundlers like vite,nextJS,parcel etc
All the main code is in src folder and the main execution is started from main.jsx

#                                                        !!! Immportant !!!

All the components should be named with first letter as Capital. 
The syntax is :
```
function App(){
    return (
        <>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        </>
    )
}
export default App
```
