# useState();

This hook is used to propagate the changes in the DOM.

## Syntax :-

you can use it as 

`useState(<initial value>)`

and it return an array with two entries

so the full syntax is

```
    let [counter,setCounter]=useState(0);
```

Now this `setCounter` method will be responsible for updating the value of `counter` inside the DOM
